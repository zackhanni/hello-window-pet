                Our Story
              </h2>
              <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
                Window Pets was inspired by a simple desire: to share pictures
                of cats around the city with their owners and to be able to
                check in on how my own cats are doing while I&apos;m away. We
                believe every window pet deserves to be seen and appreciated by
                their community.
